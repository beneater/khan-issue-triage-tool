# Khan Academy Issue Triage Tool

I host this at http://www.eater.net/khanissues, but there are no server
dependencies. You can just as effectively run it from your local
filesystem if you like.

There is also an OAuth-enabled version (which allows 5000 request per hour)
at http://www.mattfaus.com/khanissues/index.html. Or, you can revert back
to unauthenticated queries with http://www.mattfaus.com/khanissues/index.html?noauth=true
